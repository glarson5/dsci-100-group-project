This initial exploration suggests we should be cautious about expecting a strong predictive relationship between age and session count."

    "Figure 1 shows the relationship between player age and the number of gameplay sessions contributed to the research server. Most players cluster near the bottom of the plot with fewer than 25 sessions, regardless of age. The nearly horizontal regression line (with a slight negative slope) indicates a very weak relationship between age and session count. \n",

    "While there are some notable outliers, particularly younger players (ages 15-25) with over 100 sessions, these high-engagement players appear across various ages. The wide confidence interval around the regression line further suggests substantial variability and uncertainty in predicting sessions based solely on age. This visual evidence supports our earlier finding from the correlation analysis that age may not be a strong predictor of player contribution to the research dataset."
